# 🧠 DSA Prep Journey – Python | LeetCode + GFG

Welcome to my structured Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) preparation repository.  
I’m solving 500+ problems using Python across LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and other platforms, aiming to master problem-solving and crack top product-based companies 💻🚀
Here I will upload some of the basic and important problems i have practiced during my prep.
